CS4052-Computer-Graphics
========================

Stuff I did for my computer graphics course which was the best course ever and I already miss it ;_;

Haha, man, this repo's a mess. I'll try and make it neater at some point. 

<s>I'll try to not include all of the shite that's not meant to be included... As soon as I figure out what I can leave out that won't break everything.</s>

<s>Current figuring this out status: My game no longer has sound.</s>

THIS REPO HAS BEEN CLEANSED
